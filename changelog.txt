Tests moves to tests.py

Fix to flatten and test for flatten.

Created Tag and SpectrumTags object wrappers to make data structures less convoluted and prevent structures like (int, [(str, (int, {int:[(str, [int])]}))]) - a real example!
	This has had the side-effect of moving flatten and expand_tag_notation (still untested) to be methods in these new classes.
	Also, some methods like MassSpectrum.find_longest_tag and MassSpectraAggregate.find_longest_tag_local are now redundant, so have been removed.
	Consequently, MassSpectraAggregate.find_longest_tag_local has been renamed to find_longest_tag.

Tests written for most methods in mass spectra classes (in runningScript for now). Still require a bit of cleaning up.
	-Max mass
	-Max intensity
	-Sort by mass
	-Filter intensity
	-Normalise intensity
	-Mass tolerance calculations
	-Find longest tag
	-Flatten tags

normalise_intensity method changed to avoid machine precision error by using Decimal.

-Significant reworking of complexity analysis and design decisions in informal_docs in progress, previously only considered some rather limited assumptions.

-MassSpectrum
	-Removed a lot of skeleton junk concerning 'breadth-first search' and the naive algorithm in MassSpectrum.py. 
		I was planning to fill this in and benchmark it, but this isn't really a bottleneck right now and there are more important concerns.
	-Number of sequence tags output was exponentially large with multiple subsequences having multiple possible tags... 
		Changed this (representing multiple possibilities inline) and added a method to expand it back out, if desired.
		This resulted in a change to provisional data structure layout, reversing the order of key:tag from compound:peaks to peak:compounds.
	-Tag search now returns a dictionary of tags under length as keys rather than a list of tags.
	-Added maximum mass finder
	-Added sorting by mass
	-Added ppm mass tolerance
	-Added helpers to expand tag notation and flatten tag dictionary to list in light of these changes

-MassSpectraAggregate
	-Added convenient wrapper for aggregate operations on mass spectra (not necessarily efficient though).
	-Added finding max mass
	-Added finding max intensity
	-Added sorting by mass
	-Added filtering intensity
	-Added normalising intensity
	-Added finding sequence tags
	-Added finding longest sequence tags
	-Added ability to link spectra ids to outputs from other methods, and filter the spectra by id
		
-Cleaned up runningScript significantly, to make it easier to test things. Also added stubs for unit testing.

-HEAVY TESTING STILL REQUIRED ON ALL OF THIS

-Added drawSpectra stub.

-Added this changelog file.
